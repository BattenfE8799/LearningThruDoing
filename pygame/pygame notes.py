Pygame notes
"""

""" What makes a video game
1. Checking player input(the event loop)
2. Use that information to place elements on the screen
    creates 1 image
start at 1 again.
30-60 per min
"""

""" What pygame actually does
1. Pygame helps you draw images (and play sounds)
2. Check for player input (input() stops your code and thus is useless for games)
3. other gamedev tools like collisions, creating text, timers, etc.
"""

""" 
Not used for commercial games
"""

"""
used to help you learn how to solve a ton a problems, can easily switch to other engines
"""
""" Surfaces
display surface- game window anything displayed goes here
-- must be unique
-- is always visible
regular surface- a single image (something imported, rendered text, or a plain color)
--needs to be put on display surface to be visible
--- flexible amount, 
---only displayed when connect to the display surface
"""


"""
displaying:
    400 height 800 width/length
    its a coordinate system
    0,0 is in top left
    right is x
    down is y
    the surface coords is the top left of the surface
"""

""" creating text
1.create image of the text
2. place it on the display surface
1. create a font(text size and style)
2. write text on a surface
3. put surface on surface
"""
"""
animation:
screen.blit(snail_surface,(600,250)) numbers make it static
increase snail position by 1
"""

""" rectangles
1. precise positioning of surfaceses
2. basic collisions
3. drawing with pygame.draw
-
image information is placed on surface
position information is placed on a rectangle
use both to create sprites
----
can make using tupe (x,y) or indivudual values
"""
""" Collision
checking if 1 rectangle intersects with another
rect1.collidepoint((x,y)) 
--checks if one point collides with rectangle. used with mouse points
"""
""" Mouse
rect1.collidepoint((x,y))
getting mouse position by targeting with pygame.mouse or an event loop
pygame.mouse
gets info on where mouse is, clicks, visibility etc
event loop
gets mousemotion, clicks, etc
"""
"""Colors
1. RGB (red green blue) mix them and get custom color between 0 and 255 for each
2. Hexadecimal #rrggbb between 00 and ff
"""
"""movement of player
1. keyboard input
--pygame.key or loop
2. jump +gravity
3. creating a floor

most efficent for game
Button press then mouse position/collision = jump
not mouse pos/collision = jump
"""
"""
when using classes you want the controls inside the relevant class. pygame.mouse and pygame.keys are great for that
"""
"""
create floor:
    inefficeint by checking collision between player and floor
    
"""
"""TIME
pygame.time.get_ticks()
1.update score on every frame
2. put that on a surface
3. display that surface
"""
""" Transforming surfaces
how to scale, rotate etc surfaces


"""

""" displaying score in the game over screen
1. we store the score in a function
2. current_time needs to be global or returned
3. 

"""
"""Better enemy logic
spawning multiple obstacles
-timers
--create a customer user event that is triggered by pygame at certain time intervals
1. create custome event
2. tell pygame to trigger that event continuously
3. add code in the event loop

1.create a list of obstacle rectangles
2. everytime the timer triggers we add a new rectablge to that list
3. we move every rectangle in that list to the left on every frame
4. we delete rectangles too far left

create sprite
place sprites in group or groupSingle
