 ##^^ goes through each line of the file and splits the line into cells. 
 #Using a double: for loop, is a common way of working with grids.
 #x and y keep track of cooridinates
 #when finding the starting room, that position is saved, because we will use it later
 #global variable will let up access the starting_position variable outside of this method
 #_world is a dicationary that maps a coordinate pair to a title. 
 #_world[(x,y)] creates the key(coordinate pair) of the dictionary. 
 #if tile is empty string we dont want to store a tile in its place, so None if tile_name == ''
 #creates tile if contains name
 
 #getattr method is build into python
 #lets reflect into the tile module and find the class whose name matches the tile_name.
 #(x,y) passes the coords to the constructor of the tile
